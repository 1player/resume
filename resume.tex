\datedsubsection{Punters Lounge}{Technical Director / Lead software engineer}{2016--2021}

\begin{itemize}
\item Modernised the entire server infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible scripts, packaged all applications into end-to-end tested containers. Eliminated single-points-of-failure with the introduction of Docker Swarm clustering, load balancers and distributed file servers.
\item Designed an Elixir backend service that ingests betting odds from multiple bookmaker APIs, and integrates them into a quasi-realtime view of the European sport and betting world. This service has been designed to be completely automated, with a web interface powered by Phoenix Live View to control and inspect its operation. The final, cleaned data is exported via GraphQL to a React/Next.js frontend website.
\item Started as a freelance PHP developer, promoted in 2018 to Technical Director to oversee the entire engineering department of the company. Helped increase revenue by 300\%, shrunk infrastructure costs by half and massively reduced technical debt.
